# Repeat Pronunciation

### Video Demo:  `NO URL HERE`

### Description: A small Python project for repeating and learning the pronunciation of English words

The basic idea is to add a list of words you have trouble pronouncing, then review and listen to them one by one. Each known word can be excluded from the list.

Requirements:

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it! A README.md in the neighborhood of 500 words is likely to be sufficient for describing your project and all aspects of its functionality. If unable to reach that threshold, that probably means your project is insufficiently complex.
